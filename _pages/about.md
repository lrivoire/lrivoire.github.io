  I am primarily interested in the role of the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere in the climate. I also work to understand how sampling biases and observational uncertainties affect our understanding of the climate.

  I work as a Postdoctoral Associate with [Dr. Arlene Fiore](https://www.teampaccc.mit.edu/) at MIT's department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences, and [Dr. Sebastian Eastham](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/s.eastham) at Imperial College London.
