# Hi! I'm Louis, an atmospheric scientist

<img src="../images/STJ_website.gif" alt="wind magnitude" style="width:50%;">

I am primarily interested in the role of the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere in the climate. I also work to understand how sampling biases and observational uncertainties affect our understanding of the climate. 

I work as a Postdoctoral Associate with [Dr. Arlene Fiore](https://www.teampaccc.mit.edu/) at MIT's department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences.
