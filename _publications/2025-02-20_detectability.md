permalink: /publication/2025-02-20-detectability
excerpt: 'This paper shows how uncertainties in downward-looking spaceborne retrievals (for instance SBUV) affect the degree of confidence placed in long-term trends in lower stratospheric ozone, with important implications for the longest historical records about the ozone hole and its recovery.'
