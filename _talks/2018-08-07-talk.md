Talk at NOAA's Center for Satellite Applications and Research COoperative Research Program workshop, discussing the thermal structure of cut-off lows in the north Atlantic derived from [COSMIC](https://cdaac-www.cosmic.ucar.edu) GPS radio occultation temperature retrievals, and including a climatology of cut-off low tracks made --by hand-- with great care and effort by [John A.
