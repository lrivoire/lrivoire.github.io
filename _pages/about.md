  I am primarily interested in the role of the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere in the climate. I also work to understand how sampling biases and observational uncertainties affect our understanding of the climate.
  <br><br>
  I work as a Postdoctoral Associate with <a href="https://www.teampaccc.mit.edu/">Dr. Arlene Fiore</a> at MIT's department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences, and <a href="https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/s.eastham">Dr. Sebastian Eastham</a> at Imperial College London.
