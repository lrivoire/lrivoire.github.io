Hi! My name is Louis, I am an atmospheric scientist.

My main area of expertise involves the dynamical and radiative processes that take place in the tropical upper troposphere (14-17 km altitude) and lower stratosphere (17-20 km) in the vicinity of tropical convective systems (hurricanes and other mesoscale systems). My [Ph.D. dissertation](https://mountainscholar.org/handle/10217/208553) focused on the cold, synoptic-scale signal that forms above intensifying hurricanes--signal which my collaborators and I call "tropopause layer cooling", and which I affectionately refer to as "TLC".

I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in [Dr. Marianna Linz's group](https://eps.harvard.edu/people/faculty-groups/linz-group) at Harvard University's Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences. Dr. Linz and I's ongoing research into the circulation of the stratosphere is motivated by the lack of
