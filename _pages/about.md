Hello! My name is Louis, I am an atmospheric scientist.

My research focuses on tropical convection: how it works, how it organizes into larger phenomena like hurricanes, how it affects the Earth's climate, and how it might change in the future. I work as a postdoctoral fellow with [Dr. Marianna Linz](https://eps.harvard.edu/people/faculty-groups/linz-group) at Harvard University's Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences. More on my research [here](https://lrivoire.github.io/research/).

I like spending time simply watching clouds! Some pictures are available here for your enjoyment: [Earth gazing](https://lrivoire.github.io/earth_gazing/). I also like talking about science with nonscientists, and my [Illustrated science](https://lrivoire.github.io/illustrated_science/) project (coming soon) aims to make my research more accessible to all.
