  I am interested in the role of atmospheric jet streams in weather, climate, and air quality. I also work to optimize the design of future satellites.
  <br><br>
  I am currently a Postdoctoral Associate with <a href="https://www.teampaccc.mit.edu/">Dr. Arlene Fiore</a> at MIT, and <a href="https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/s.eastham">Dr. Sebastian Eastham</a> at Imperial College London.
