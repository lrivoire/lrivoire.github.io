Hi! My name is Louis, I am an atmospheric scientist.

I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in [Dr. Marianna Linz's group](https://eps.harvard.edu/people/faculty-groups/linz-group) at Harvard University's Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences. Dr. Linz and I are interested in the circulation of the stratosphere, which we study using simulations of the Earth's atmosphere and measurements of its chemical composition from satellites, aircrafts and balloons.

My main area of expertise involves the dynamical and radiative processes that take place in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (~14-20 km altitude) near tropical convective systems. I am particularly interested in the cold, synoptic-scale signal that forms above intensifying hurricanes, which my collaborators and I call "tropopause layer cooling" (and which I affectionately refer to as "TLC").
